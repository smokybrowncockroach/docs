The feature is fairly obscure and requires specific String fields to be set on a Password Entry.\nThis feature is best suited for power users. Non-technical users should strongly consider using a user-friendly KeePass plugin instead. Configuring KeePass Start by creating a new Password Entry. Fill in the Title, User name, and other basic fields as desired. For Password, enter in the value {TIMEOTP}. In the Advanced tab, add a new String field. For the name of the string field, specify TimeOtp-Secret-Base32. For the value, enter in the OTP seed value (usually obtained by clicking a \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t have a camera\u0026rdquo; button for the service you are trying to add 2FA to). Save and close the entry. New one-time passwords may be obtained by right-clicking the entry and selecting Copy Password. Additional fields that may be used to configure 2FA password length and expiry period can be found on the KeePass website. Usually the defaults are acceptable.
